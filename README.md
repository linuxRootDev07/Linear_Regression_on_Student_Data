# Linear_Regression_on_Student_Data
Linear regression is a fundamental statistical technique used in machine learning and statistics to model the relationship between a dependent variable (usually denoted as 'Y') and one or more independent variables (often denoted as 'X'). Its primary purpose is to establish a linear equation that best describes the relationship between these variables. The key points to understand about linear regression are its simplicity and interpretability, making it a valuable tool for predicting and understanding continuous numerical outcomes. 

Linear regression models can have single or multiple predictors, leading to simple linear regression and multiple linear regression, respectively. The goal is to find the coefficients that minimize the difference between the predicted and actual values, often done through the least squares method. This technique has various applications in fields such as economics, finance, biology, and more.
